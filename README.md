### Description

Disconnected is a game about playing as a telephone switchboard operator.  It serves as a look into the high-stress, very demanding jobs that once were filled by industrious women around the globe.  Based on real switchboard models and practices (aka what I read on Wikipedia), this game attempts to provide accurate switchboard simulation.
